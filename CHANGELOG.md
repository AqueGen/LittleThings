### Features

* remove the bar menu and windows beyond Blizzard's three - both confirmed in game to taint the meter until reload; Shown on the panel offers a reload ([e5568c5](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/e5568c530092d08816e77ccdd3435a03b11e1bca))


### Bug Fixes

* compose readable numbers with Blizzard's own format strings and rounding ([b78f450](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/b78f450b9479b15fc9ec3eb3aa11ff5888a6ef68))

* no menu entries of ours in combat - a tainted entry makes the menu layout measure Secret rects; the type-menu additions are gone, the gear settings entry is out-of-combat only ([ba6139d](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/ba6139dd42c410fa24b885cf6e0e4561ce1ab2e9))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* remove hover-to-open - opening Blizzard's breakdown from addon code taints its rows until reload; the right-click menu stays

### Features

* details on hover as a frame of our own fed from C_DamageMeter, works in combat; the secure right-click could not open a dropdown and is gone, the type menu keeps lock, hide, reset and settings ([7a46e33](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/7a46e3320c90ff344b0c19a8db44e84538a5e4ff))

* right-click on the bars opens the window's own type menu through a secure click, with lock, hide, reset and settings appended - Blizzard's code all the way, works in combat ([52fe2ab](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/52fe2abf3f58d13c51899d17c8d8a3b40f4d12a2))
* the Shown box is back on the Windows page; showing offers a reload, which is what clears the taint ([c2d7d56](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/c2d7d5676e8a1c17ea4496655210ac1d2663f4bb))


### Bug Fixes

* hover waits for combat to end on the server too - a fresh fetch with a readable source name is the signal ([38a6619](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/38a6619b5a4a17a029c526143d1a75e4020c41b4))
* keep the paint driver last in the OnUpdate order so a deferred ScrollBox update cannot repaint over it ([43d5da4](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/43d5da4b9c484929e79389d19a16438981356147))
* paint the numbers every frame out of combat too - a click's refresh showed Blizzard's format for a moment ([e8f2273](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/e8f2273bd9bd82f33140c242071762234ee3a61c))

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) (2026-09-07)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* cut every path that writes into Blizzard's meter windows - hover, the bar menu, addon windows, showing a window from addon code - so combat stays warning-free
* remove readable numbers - the values are Secret to addons in combat and a format that only holds between pulls is worse than none
* rename to DamageMeterCompanion, migrate saved variables, add a settings entry to the meter's own dropdown

### Features

* /dmc entryhooks isolates the InitEntry hooks from the taint warning ([2702498](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/270249801679115a0a4b8dc426ef8b084bb3b2a8))

* readable numbers are back, painted the way Details does it - the client abbreviates the Secret value and the bar shows the result ([434ab82](https://github.com/AqueGen/DamageMeterCompanion/commit/434ab823fddfc144e7fe7b2bfc932b54a7a83826))
